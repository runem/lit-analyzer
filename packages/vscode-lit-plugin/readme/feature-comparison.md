## Feature comparison

This plugin is similar to [vscode-lit-html](https://github.com/mjbvz/vscode-lit-html) on many points. The power of `vscode-lit-html` is that it covers all the basic functionality of HTML in tagged templates, so it's a plugin that can be easily used with other libraries than `lit-html`. However `vscode-lit-plugin` (this one) aims to be a specialized plugin for working with `lit-element / lit-html`, so for example it supports `css` and discovers web components out of the box.

Below is a comparison table of the two plugins:
