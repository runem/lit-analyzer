## Other features

[Rules](#-rules) as described before, gives you diagnostics directly in your code. Features described in this section will give you super powers by making your lit-html templates come to life.

### üö∂Goto definition

`Cmd+Click (Mac)` / `Ctrl+Click (Windows)` on a tag, attribute, property or event name and goto the definition.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Code completions for css and html

Press `Ctrl+Space` in an html or css context and to get code completions.

### üìñ Quick info on hover for html tags and attributes

Hover above a tag, attribute, property or event and see more information about the identifier such as type and jsdoc.

### üö™ Auto close tags

When typing html inside a template tag `lit-plugin` auto-closes tags as you would expect.

### üîç Automatically finds custom elements

If you define a custom element somewhere in your code `lit-plugin` will automatically find it. Then it will provide auto-import functionality, type checking and code completion out of the box by analyzing the element. [web-component-analyzer](https://github.com/runem/web-component-analyzer) is the tool that takes care of analyzing components.

### üåé Support for dependencies that extend the global HTMLElementTagNameMap

If a dependency with Typescript definitions extends the global `HTMLElementTagNameMap` this plugin will pick up on the map between the tag name and the class. Below you will see an example of what to add to your library typescript definition files if you want type checking support for a given html tag.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
declare global {
  interface HTMLElementTagNameMap {
    "my-element": MyElement;
  }
}
```

**Two limitations using this approach as of now**

- By using this approach the plugin wont see detailed information about a given element as (e.g @property decorators and initializers) because it can only read public fields and their corresponding types. Therefore all properties on custom elements imported from libraries are optional and wont respect meta information in @property decorators.
- `lit-plugin` will only be able two find your elements if you somewhere in the code imports the file. Before your import the file it will complain that the element is unknown not that it can be imported. This due to the constraint that Typescript only adds library files to the array of program files once the file has been imported.

This plugin already supports [custom vscode html data format](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_31#_html-and-css-custom-data-support) (see the configuration section) and I will of course work on supporting more ways of shipping metadata alongside custom elements.
